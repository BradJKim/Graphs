Completed: 5/2/23 
Uploaded to github: 11/18/23

Implementation for java Adjacency Graph and Array Graph that store nodes data values with nodes or arrays.
Array graph stores vertex relationships between neighbors and Adjacency graph stores vertex relationships through nodes and ArrayLists.
Features include determined number of neighbors and printing out graphs that represent the node/graph structure values.
